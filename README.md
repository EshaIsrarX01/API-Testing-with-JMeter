# API Testing Portfolio with Apache JMeter üöÄ

Hello üëãüèªüôÇ and welcome‚ú® to my **API Testing Portfolio**! This repository showcases a comprehensive collection of **Apache JMeter** test plans meticulously designed to demonstrate various facets of API testing, including fundamental **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations and robust **data-driven testing** strategies.

This project was diligently prepared by **Esha Israr**.

---

## üåü Project Overview

This repository serves as a practical guide and illustrative example of API testing scenarios using **JMeter**. My primary goal is to provide clear, executable, and well-documented test plans that showcase effective interaction with **RESTful APIs**, precise data validation, and efficient test data management.

---

## ‚ú® Key Features & Accomplished Tasks

This portfolio addresses the following core API testing objectives, each implemented with attention to detail and best practices:

### 1. Comprehensive CRUD Operations with Individual Listeners üìä

* **Objective**: To perform and monitor individual `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` API requests, ensuring granular insights into each operation.

* **Implementation**: Each HTTP request sampler is thoughtfully configured with at least two dedicated listeners (e.g., `View Results Tree`, `Summary Report`, `Aggregate Report`). This setup provides in-depth analysis of response data, performance metrics, and assertion results for every specific API call.

* **API Used**: [reqres.in](https://reqres.in) (a reliable mock API for basic request/response testing).

---

### 2. Chained CRUD Operations with Persistence Verification üîó

* **Objective**: To demonstrate a complete CRUD lifecycle where a resource is created, retrieved, updated, and then truly deleted, with robust verification of its absence.

* **Implementation**: A sequential flow of `POST`, `GET`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` requests is executed. The unique ID generated by the `POST` request is dynamically extracted and seamlessly utilized in all subsequent operations. A final `GET` request rigorously verifies the successful deletion by asserting a `404 Not Found` response, confirming the resource's removal.

* **API Used**: **Local JSON Server** (`http://localhost:3000`), chosen for its capability to provide actual data persistence for mock APIs.

---

### 3. Data-Driven Testing from CSV File üìÅ‚û°Ô∏èüìÑ

* **Objective**: To efficiently read diverse test data from an external CSV file, leverage this data to create multiple resources via `POST` requests, and then immediately retrieve and validate the created data against the original CSV input.

* **Implementation**: A `CSV Data Set Config` element is employed to read username and userjob data from `users.csv`. For each row in the CSV, a `POST` request creates a new product, and a subsequent `GET` request retrieves and meticulously verifies that the product's details (title and description) accurately match the corresponding CSV input.

* **API Used**: **Platzi Fake Store API** (`https://api.escuelajs.co/api/v1`), which supports data persistence for this scenario.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

To ensure a smooth experience and successfully run these **JMeter** test plans on your local machine, please ensure you have the following essential tools installed:

* **Apache JMeter (v5.6.3 or higher recommended)**: The cornerstone tool for these API tests.

* **Java Development Kit (JDK 8 or higher)**: A fundamental requirement for JMeter to operate.

* **Node.js and npm**: Indispensable for setting up and running JSON Server (specifically for the chained CRUD task).

  * Install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)

  * Install JSON Server globally via npm:

    ```bash
    npm install -g json-server
    ```

* **GitHub CLI (Optional, but highly recommended for streamlined cloning)**: If you prefer using the convenient `gh repo clone` command, please ensure you have GitHub CLI installed and properly authenticated.

## üöÄ How to Use & Run the Tests

Follow these straightforward steps to explore, execute, and analyze the test plans within this repository:

### 1. Clone the Repository

If you have GitHub CLI installed (recommended for ease):

```bash
gh repo clone EshaIsrarX01/API-Testing-with-JMeter
cd API-Testing-with-JMeter
```

Alternatively, using standard Git commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EshaIsrarX01/API-Testing-with-JMeter.git
cd API-Testing-with-JMeter
```

---

### 2. Set Up JSON Server (for Chained CRUD Test)

* Navigate to the root directory of the cloned repository in your terminal.

* Create a file named `db.json` with the following content:

  ```json
  {
    "users": []
  }
  ```

* Start your local JSON Server:

  ```bash
  json-server --watch db.json --port 3000
  ```

* ‚ö†Ô∏è **Crucially, keep this terminal window open and running** throughout the duration of your JMeter tests that interact with JSON Server.

---

### 3. Prepare CSV File (for Data-Driven Test)

Ensure the `users.csv` file is correctly placed in the root directory of the cloned repository. Its structure should be:

```csv
username,userjob
eve.holt,student
charles.morris,teacher
# ... and so on for other users
```

---

### 4. Open JMeter

Launch your **Apache JMeter** application.

---

### 5. Load Test Plans

In JMeter, go to:

`File > Open...`

Navigate to the cloned repository folder and open each of the `.jmx` files:

* `CRUD Operations Thread Group_01.jmx`
* `Test plan for api request chaining_02.jmx`
* `Testing Through CSV File.jmx`

---

### 6. Run Tests & View Results

For each individual test plan you wish to execute:

* Select the desired **Test Plan** or its specific **Thread Group** in the JMeter tree.
* Go to `Run > Clear All` (to clear any previous test results).
* Click the green **Start** button in the JMeter toolbar (or use `Run > Start`).

Carefully observe the results in the attached Listeners (e.g., `View Results Tree`, `Summary Report`). A green icon typically indicates success, while red signifies a failure.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes on API Behavior

It's essential to understand the characteristics of the mock APIs used, as their behavior can influence test outcomes:

* **reqres.in (for Individual CRUD)**:
  Please be aware that **reqres.in** is a purely mock API and does not actually store any data persistently. While `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` operations will return success status codes, the data is not truly saved or altered on their server. Consequently, subsequent `GET` requests for newly "created" IDs will typically result in a `404 Not Found` response.

* **JSON Server (for Chained CRUD)**:
  This local server provides **true data persistence** by modifying your `db.json` file. Data created, updated, and deleted through your JMeter tests will be genuinely reflected and managed within your local file.

* **Platzi Fake Store API (for CSV Driven)**:
  This API is designed to simulate persistence for created resources. While `POST` and immediate `GET` operations on new items are generally consistent, the behavior for subsequent `PATCH`/`DELETE` operations on dynamically created IDs can sometimes exhibit minor variations. The test plan's assertions are specifically designed to accommodate the expected responses from this API.
