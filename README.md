API Testing Portfolio with Apache JMeter
Hello and welcome to my API Testing Portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of Apache JMeter test plans designed to demonstrate various aspects of API testing, including fundamental CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and data-driven testing strategies.

This project was meticulously prepared by Esha Israr.

üåü Project Overview
This repository contains JMeter test plans (.jmx files) that illustrate practical API testing scenarios. The primary goal is to provide clear, executable examples of how to interact with RESTful APIs using JMeter, perform data validation, and manage test data effectively.

‚ú® Key Features & Accomplished Tasks
This portfolio addresses the following core API testing objectives:

Comprehensive CRUD Operations with Individual Listeners:

Objective: To perform and monitor individual GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE API requests.

Implementation: Each HTTP request sampler is configured with at least two dedicated listeners (e.g., View Results Tree, Summary Report, Aggregate Report) to provide granular insights into response data, performance metrics, and assertion results for each specific operation.

API Used: reqres.in (a mock API for basic request/response testing).

Chained CRUD Operations with Persistence Verification:

Objective: To demonstrate a complete CRUD lifecycle where a resource is created, retrieved, updated, and then truly deleted, with verification of its absence.

Implementation: A sequence of POST, GET, PATCH, and DELETE requests is executed. The ID generated by the POST request is dynamically extracted and used in subsequent GET, PATCH, and DELETE operations. A final GET request verifies the successful deletion by asserting a 404 Not Found response.

API Used: Local JSON Server (http://localhost:3000), which provides actual data persistence for mock APIs.

Data-Driven Testing from CSV File:

Objective: To read test data from an external CSV file, use this data to create resources via POST requests, and then retrieve and validate the created data against the original CSV values.

Implementation: A CSV Data Set Config element reads username and userjob from users.csv. For each row, a POST request creates a new product, and a subsequent GET request retrieves and verifies that the product's details match the CSV input.

API Used: Platzi Fake Store API (https://api.escuelajs.co/api/v1), which supports data persistence for this scenario.

üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
To run these JMeter test plans effectively on your local machine, please ensure you have the following installed:

Apache JMeter (v5.6.3 or higher recommended): The primary tool used for these tests.

Java Development Kit (JDK 8 or higher): Required to run JMeter.

Node.js and npm: Required for setting up and running JSON Server (for the chained CRUD task).

Install Node.js from nodejs.org.

Install JSON Server globally via npm: npm install -g json-server

üöÄ How to Use & Run the Tests
Follow these steps to explore and execute the test plans:

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepositoryName.git
cd YourRepositoryName

(Replace YourUsername and YourRepositoryName with your actual GitHub details.)

Set Up JSON Server (for Chained CRUD Test):

Navigate to the repository's root directory in your terminal.

Create a file named db.json with the content: {"users": []}

Start JSON Server: json-server --watch db.json --port 3000

Keep this terminal window open while running the JMeter tests that use JSON Server.

Prepare CSV File (for Data-Driven Test):

Ensure the users.csv file is present in the root directory of the cloned repository. Its content should be:

username,userjob
eve.holt,student
charles.morris,teacher
# ... and so on for other users

Open JMeter: Launch your Apache JMeter application.

Load Test Plans:

Go to File > Open... in JMeter.

Navigate to the cloned repository folder and open each .jmx file:

CRUD Operations Thread Group_01.jmx

Test plan for api request chaining_02.jmx

Testing Through CSV File.jmx

Run Tests & View Results:

For each test plan you wish to run:

Select the Test Plan or the specific Thread Group in the JMeter tree.

Go to Run > Clear All (to clear previous results).

Click the green "Start" button in the toolbar (or Run > Start).

Observe the results in the attached Listeners (e.g., "View Results Tree", "Summary Report"). Green indicates success, red indicates failure.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes on API Behavior
reqres.in (for Individual CRUD): Please be aware that reqres.in is a mock API and does not actually store data. POST, PUT, and DELETE operations will return success codes, but the data is not persistently saved or altered on their server. Subsequent GETs for newly created IDs will likely return 404 Not Found.

JSON Server (for Chained CRUD): This local server provides true persistence by modifying your db.json file. Data created, updated, and deleted through JMeter will be reflected in db.json.

Platzi Fake Store API (for CSV Driven): This API simulates persistence for created resources. While POST and GET operations on new items are generally consistent, behavior for PATCH/DELETE on dynamically created IDs can sometimes vary. The test plan is designed to assert for the expected responses from this API.
